This projet contains a clock design make in HTML & CSS.
This clock is functional thanks to CSS animations.
I focused on block element centering styles like: 
display: flex;
align-items: center;
justify-content: center;

I focused on element position styles like:
position: relative;
position: absolute;
top: value;
left: value;
